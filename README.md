## The problems include: 
* Optimal-Cost path finding in a grid with obstacales & multiple goals. Comparing: BFS,DFS,Greedy,UCS,A* & it's variations.
* Restoring the original text from a scrambled set of words, using local search methods & given a utility function. Comparing: SAHC, SAHC with sideways steps & escaping local maximum. Implementing discrete algebra to prove equivalence between algorithms and showing the problem can be reduced to finding a desired permutation.
